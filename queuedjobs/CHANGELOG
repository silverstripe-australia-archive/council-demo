2012-09-13 v1.8.1
-----------------

  and display messages better

2012-09-12 v1.8.0
-----------------

* Added ability to have jobs executed by Gearman
* Removed the 'immediate' mode feature; this can be done by using the 
  ImmediateQueueHandler via config instead -

2012-09-06 v1.7.0
-----------------

* Updates for SS3 compatibility

2012-06-18 v1.6.0
-----------------

* Allow for running in 'immediate' mode where jobs are executed as soon as they
  are queued, removing the need for cron (ie if you don't have access to set 
  one up) 

2012-04-18 v1.5.4
-----------------

* Additional changes to better work around subsites problems


2012-04-04 v1.5.3
-----------------

* Make sure to change the current runas user when doing onShutdown queue
  emptying

2012-03-09 v1.5.2
-----------------

* Fixed small bug with setting the base URL for a subsites job
  where it failed to append a trailing slash

2012-03-02 v1.5.1
-----------------

* Changed queuedjob service to only process 'immediate' jobs if executed
  from commandline to prevent the possibility of session bleeding as SS 
  doesn't provide a nice way to switch user context

2012-01-18 v1.5.0
-----------------

* Allow arbitrarily named queues

2012-01-09 v1.4.3
-----------------

* Added 'afterComplete' method to handle stuff after a job finishes 
  successfully

2012-01-05 v1.4.2
-----------------

* Allow deletion of jobs that fail to initialise properly

2011-10-31 v1.4.1
-----------------

* Broken jobs on the queue will now cause an ERR to be logged each hour,
  allowing emails to be hooked and sent alerting admins of the issue

2011-10-20 v1.4.0
-----------------

* Allow the setting and retrieving of objects associated with jobs

2011-09-08 v1.3.7
-----------------

* Handle setting of temporary user in a better way

2011-08-03 v1.3.6
-----------------

* Can configure the output folder for queuedjob files directly

2011-07-27 v1.3.5
-----------------

* Jobs track the subsite ID if available so that offline execution executes
  in the correct 'subsite' context
* The delete job now processes in 'immediate' mode

2011-07-20 v1.3.4
-----------------

* Change the default behaviour to use the shutdown function method of 
  executing immediate mode queuedjobs, instead of assuming the lsyncd config
  is set up

2011-06-07 v1.3.3
-----------------

* Small fix to ensure that the queued job cache folder is created on
  the disk whenever dev/build is run. This is so that watchers can
  bind to the folder immediately...

2011-05-24 v1.3.2
-----------------

* Fixed bug where deleted job not cleaned up properly

2011-05-24 v1.3.1
-----------------

* Added example script for managing immediate jobs using the inotifywait
  functionality 

2011-04-29 v1.3.0
-----------------

* Added ability for immediate jobs to be processed by a file based queue 
  mechanism using something like inotifywait. Means that immediatemode 
  jobs are still executed asynchronously, but are still processed immediately

2011-04-28 v1.2.3
-----------------

* Added a queued job to schedule deletions

2011-04-12 v1.2.2
-----------------

  https://github.com/nyeholt/silverstripe-queuedjobs/pull/1
* Renamed CreateDummyJob task to CreateQueuedJobTask to be a bit clearer. 

2011-02-16 v1.2.1
-----------------

* Emergency bugfix in testcase that breaks builds!

2011-02-15 v1.2.0
-----------------

* Added a generic scheduled execution job that can be added to any
  data object and it will automatically get scheduled execution support. 

2011-01-20 v1.1.1
-----------------

* Change sorting of job list to use 'start after' date

2010-12-29 v1.1.0
-----------------

* Use php's serialise instead of JSON serialisation (what was I thinking!).
  We're not going to be doing JS distribution just yet...
* Version bump as the serialisation change may have some weird effects
  on existing scheduled jobs that have complex data serialised

2010-12-24 v1.0.6
-----------------
* Fix bug where admins couldn't execute other users' jobs via the UI

2010-12-12 v1.0.5
-----------------

-----------------

* Allow jobs to be deleted when they're paused

2010-11-29 v1.0.3
-----------------

* FEATURE: Added abiltity to directly execute a job from the queue without needing the background process running. Job executes immediately in browser as the user running the job

2010-11-11 v1.0.2
-----------------

* Added ability to specify a RunAs user when creating the job

2010-11-06 v1.0.1
-----------------

* Update to fix a javascript problem referencing the wrong url

-----------------

* Helper to double check the status of any 'running' job that may have stalled.
* Added example job that generates a google sitemap in the background
  (instead of each request). Handy for large sites.

v0.1.2
-------------

* Added additional method prepareForRestart that is called on QueuedJobs
  whenever a job is restarted

v0.1.1
-------------

* Changed admin URL param (seriously, why on earth did I put _queued-jobs?)
* Added more memory information

2010-06-20 v0.1.0
-------------

* Added better support for jobs that should be executed after a particular
  time delay. 

2010-05-15 v0.1.0 RC1
-----------------


* Initital release
* Cron based initiation of a single task that manages the processing of jobs
  that take more processing than what is feasible to achieve in a single
  HTTP request. Manages the queueing, state and continuation of jobs over
  time to ensure load doesn't become too high on the server.
