Overview
--------

A Module that allows users to create custom data lists. These lists can then 
be used in a form control (specified via code by a developer) or within a 
user defined form to be able to define controlled vocabularies managed
in a central location that might be used across several forms. 

Dynamic Lists is the SS3 Version of [Nyeholt's DataList module](https://github.com/nyeholt/silverstripe-datalists)
